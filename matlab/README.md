### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for running the simple walker in MATLAB in the paper "Humans plan for the near future to walk economically on uneven terrain", PNAS 2023

The main file OPTIMIZATION_RIMLESS_WHEEL_MPC_MS_v5 has the explanations about how the optimization and the model works. 

To run, all you need to do is running the main file OPTIMIZATION_RIMLESS_WHEEL_MPC_MS_v5.

For now the models walksw2, walkrw2 and walkrw2uneven are not used. They are added for inheritence of the model walkrw2unevel.
