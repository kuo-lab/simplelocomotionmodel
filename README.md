    * `activate .` loads this project's environment
    * `instantiate` to download and install relevant packages

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### Demos
* `tinydemo.jl` is the simplest demo. From Julia prompt, `include("src/tinydemo.jl")` to run it.
  
    Try executing `tinydemo.jl` in VS Code. Set the Julia environment to `simplelocomotionmodel`, run the code using e.g. shift-Enter.
* `tinynotebook.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook, which can be run from VS code.
* `demo.qmd` is a Quarto document, which is a general-purpose document like Jupyter, but can be converted into a variety of formats such as PDF, Word, html. We will serve the demos as a combination of Jupyter and Quarto.
