Notebooks and code for optimization of a pendulum-like model of locomotion. Dynamical model performs walking tasks specified by optimal control. Human experiments to test model are described in publications.   

## [Optimization of energy and time predicts dynamic speeds for human walking [@carlisle2022OptimizationEnergyTime]](src/shortwalks.ipynb)
![short walks](img/shortwalks.svg)
This [notebook](src/shortwalks.ipynb) demonstrates a dynamic optimization for taking short walking bouts of varying length. The model starts and ends at standing rest, and self-selects (optimizes) the steps to minimize an energy-time objective.  Energy is expressed as the total
push-off work performed by the model, and time is the total duration of
the walk, scaled by a time valuation constant $c_t$. Human experimental data and code are available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/kuo-lab/short_walk_experiment).

## [Humans plan for the near future to walk economically on uneven terrain [@darici2022HumansPlanFuture]](src/uneventerrain.ipynb)
![walking on uneven terrain](img/uneventerrainwalking.svg)
This [notebook](src/uneventerrain.ipynb) demonstrates a dynamic optimization for walking on uneven terrain. The model plans ahead for upcoming steps, and determines a trajectory of push-offs and forward walking speed that minimizes the energy and time expended for the terrain. Energy is the push-off work performed by the model, and the time duration is set to equal the time to walk the same distance on flat ground.  


### About the model
The "simplest walking model" [@kuo2002EnergeticsActivelyPowereda] models the legs as simple pendulums. There is a point mass for the body, and infinitesimal point masses for the feet. For the present publications, walking speed varies by relatively small amounts, for which modulation of the swing leg is treated as having low cost. For increasing speeds and step frequencies, the model's swing leg cost increases sharply [@kuo2001SimpleModelBipedala]. 

The optimization is performed withj the [Julia language](https://julialang.org), a fully open-source language. It uses open-source packages for optimization ([JuMP](https://jump.dev/) and for model dynamics [DynLoco](https://github.com/kuo-lab/DynLoco)). The emphasis here is on simplicity and code readability. The Julia code provides a minimal demonstration of the mechanics and optimization approach. The entire tool chain is open source.

Users are invited to view the notebooks and source code in this repository. Motivated individuals may also wish to execute and modify the code themselves, which necessitates installation of Julia.

### Installation
* Install Julia according to the [Getting Started guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/)
* The Jupyter notebooks also require installation of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Assuming a [Python](https://www.python.org/) installation, Jupyter may be installed with [`pip`](https://jupyter.org/install) or [`conda`](https://anaconda.org/main/jupyter).
* Run Julia from the `simplelocomotionmodel` directory
* Install packages using package manager, from the Julia prompt:
    * `Using Pkg` 
    * `Pkg.activate()` activates an environment with relevant packages
    * `Pkg.instantiate()` downloads and installs packages (can take several minutes)
* The Jupyter notebooks have file extension `ipynb` and can be opened and executed with a variety of viewers. A recommended workflow uses the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editing environment, which can open, execute, and render Jupyter notebooks.

### Dependencies
The model equations are implemented in the [DynLoco](https://github.com/kuo-lab/DynLoco) package with Julia. This package is automatically installed with the present repository's environment (see `instantiate` above). All other dependencies are within the Julia packages and managed with the environment, so that no additional management is necessary. Jupyter notebooks are generated with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), with source provided in `.qmd` files. Quarto is not necessary to open and interact with Jupyter notebooks.
