A simple walking model is optimized to walk over uneven terrain. The objective is to minimize energy expenditure, quantified by the push-off work performed with each step. The optimization here seeks to traverse a stretch of terrain, starting and ending at level walking, and taking the same amount of time as level walking. 

## Walk over a single upward step 
The optimal compensation for a single upward step is to speed up beforehand, lose speed stepping upward, and then speed up again afterward. The optimal speed-ups both occur over several steps but have different shapes: the first one increases nearly exponentially with time, and the second one resembles a saturating exponential. The optimization is described by Darici et al. [-@darici2020AnticipatoryControlMomentum], and tested with human subjects experiment [@darici2022HumansOptimallyAnticipate].

```{julia}
using DynLoco, Plots; 

wstar4s = findgait(WalkRW2l(α=0.4,safety=true), target=:speed=>0.45, varying=:P)
nsteps = 15
δs = zeros(nsteps); δs[Int((nsteps+1)/2)] = 0.05 # one bump
nominalresult = optwalk(wstar4s, nsteps, boundarywork=false, δs=δs)

p = multistepplot(nominalresult, boundarywork=false, legend=false) # plot speed, push-off, terrain heights
display(p)

p = plot(cumsum(nominalresult.steps.tf), nominalresult.steps.vm,xlabel="time",ylabel="midstance speed",legend=false)
display(p)

# step timings, per step
plot(cumsum(nominalresult.steps.tf),nominalresult.steps.tf, xlabel="time",ylabel="step time", legend=false)
```
The optimization is performed with `optwalk`, which computes the minimum-work trajectory for `nsteps` of walking. A terrain may be provided by an array of height/angle changes `δs`.

All quantities are plotted in dimensionless form, with base units of body mass $M$, leg length $L$, and gravitational acceleration $g$. Thus speed is normalized by $\sqrt(gL)$ and time by $\sqrt(L/g)$. For a typical leg length of $L = 1\,\mathrm{m}$, the equivalent dimensional speed is about 1.25 m/s, and step time about 0.55 s.  

## Use varying step lengths to walk over a single upward step 
The model above uses fixed step lengths, whereas humans adjust step length with speed. The model can also be constrained to step at the preferred step length vs speed relationship of human, resulting in a different amplitude of speed fluctuations, but a similarly-shaped speed profile. 
```{julia}
δs = zeros(nsteps); δs[Int((nsteps+1)/2)] = 0.05 # one bump
nominalmsr=optwalk(wstar4s, nsteps, boundarywork=false, δs=δs)
# WalkRW2ls has varying step lengths according to preferred human
wstar4ls = findgait(WalkRW2ls(α=0.4,safety=true), target=:speed=>0.45, varying=:P, cstep=0.35, vmstar=wstar4s.vm)
varyingmsr = optwalk(wstar4ls, nsteps, boundarywork=false,δs=δs)
plotvees(nominalmsr,boundaryvels=nominalmsr.boundaryvels, speedtype=:midstance)
plotvees!(varyingmsr,boundaryvels=nominalmsr.boundaryvels, speedtype=:midstance)
```

## Walk over a bunch of terrains
The terrain is specified as a series of angle/height changes each step. The task is to start and end with nominal level walking, and to traverse the terrain in minimum energy, in the same amount of time as for level walking.
```{julia}
B = 0.05 # bump height, nondimensionalized to leg length L (nominal L = 1 m)
# (bump height affects amplitude of velocity change, but not the shape)

# A bunch of terrains
δs = ( # terrain defined a sequence of height or angle changes from previous step
    "U" =>    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .* B, # Up
    "D" =>    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .* B, # Down
    "UD" =>   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .* B, # Up-Down
    "DnUD" => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .* B, # Down & Up-Down
    "P" =>    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .* B, # Pyramid
    "C1" =>   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .* B, # Complex 1
    "C2" =>   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .* B, # Complex 2
)
p = plot(layout=(2,4), legend=false); plotnum = 1;
for (terrainname, terrainbumps) in δs
    results = optwalk(wstar4s, length(terrainbumps), δs=terrainbumps, boundarywork = false) # optimize push-offs (boundarywork=false means start from nominal walking)
    plotvees!(p[plotnum], results, boundaryvels=results.boundaryvels, speedtype=:midstance, 
        usespline=false,title=terrainname)
    plotnum = plotnum + 1
end
display(p)
```

## Walk over a simple bump with no compensation
Model walks with constant push-offs for steady walking, and encounters the up-step without any compensation. As a result of the unexpected upward step, the model loses speed, and with repeated constant push-offs, will eventually regain nominal speed. The number of regaining steps is described by the persistence distance. This model expends the same energy as level walking, but accumulates a relative time deficit. The same push-off impulses are applied in both cases, but the no-compensation case loses speed, resulting in slightly less work. More detail is available from @darici2020AnticipatoryControlMomentum.

```{julia}
upstep = δs[1][2] # first terrain, get the terrain array
nsteps = length(upstep)
nocompresult = multistep(wstar4s, Ps=fill(wstar4s.P,nsteps),δangles=upstep,boundaryvels=(wstar4s.vm,wstar4s.vm))
println("No compensation total work cost = ", nocompresult.totalcost)
println("Nominal walking total work cost = ", nominalresult.totalcost)
p = multistepplot(nocompresult, legend=false, boundarywork=false)
display(p)
plot(cumsum(nominalresult.steps.tf),label="nominal level")
plot!(cumsum(nocompresult.steps.tf), xlabel="step",ylabel="accumulated time", label="no compensation")
println("Final time deficit = ", -sum(nominalresult.steps.tf)+sum(nocompresult.steps.tf))
```

## Walk over a single bump with a reactive compensation
Model does not anticipate the up-step and loses speed and time upon first contact with it. Thereafter, the model compensates and catches up to the level ground model by looking ahead and adjusting the trajectory of push-offs. It therefore actually anticipates and optimally compensates for all steps except the first uneven one. This is because there is no way to regain time without some knowledge and goal for the terrain ahead. A model that never looks ahead at all would be unable to walk the same number of steps in the same time as level walking. More detail is available from @darici2020AnticipatoryControlMomentum. 

```{julia}
nbump = Int(floor((nsteps+1)/2))
reactresults1 = multistep(wstar4s, Ps=fill(wstar4s.P,nbump),δangles=upstep[1:nbump],boundaryvels=(wstar4s.vm,wstar4s.vm))
reactresults2 = optwalk(wstar4s, nsteps-nbump, totaltime = nominalmsr.totaltime - reactresults1.totaltime,boundaryvels=(reactresults1.steps[end].vm,wstar4s.vm), boundarywork=(false,false))
reactresult = cat(reactresults1, reactresults2)
println("Reactive contrl total work cost = ", reactresult.totalcost)
println("Nominal walking total work cost = ", nominalresult.totalcost)
multistepplot(reactresult,boundarywork=false) # plot concatenation of two simulations
p = plot(cumsum(nominalresult.steps.tf),label="nominal level")
plot!(p, cumsum(reactresult.steps.tf), xlabel="step",ylabel="accumulated time", label="reactive")
display(p)
println("Final time deficit = ", -sum(nominalresult.steps.tf)+sum(reactresult.steps.tf))
